1.Project Overview
MonolithicAdventureGame is a console-based RPG where a player fights enemies, collects items, gains experience, and levels up.
After refactoring, the code follows SOLID principles, making it modular, maintainable, and scalable.
2. SOLID Principles Applied
SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)-Each class has only one responsibility (separate classes for Player, Enemy, Items, Combat, Levels, and Score).
OCP (Open/Closed Principle)-New enemies and items can be added without modifying existing code (using IEnemy and IItem interfaces).
LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)-Zombie, Vampire, and Skeleton can replace Enemy without breaking the game.
ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)-Split IEnemy and IItem instead of using one large interface.
DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)-CombatManager depends on IEnemy, not specific enemy classes, making it flexible.
3. Key Files & Classes
🔹 MainGame.java (Main File)
•	Initializes the player, score manager, level manager, and combat system.
•	Creates enemy instances and triggers battles.
•	Levels up the player and uses items.
🔹 Player.java (Player Class)
•	Stores the player’s name and score.
•	Handles enemy defeats and item usage.
🔹 CombatManager.java (Combat System)
•	Manages battles between the player and enemies.
•	Calls the defeatEnemy() method from the player class.
🔹 Enemy.java & Subclasses (Skeleton.java, Zombie.java, Vampire.java)
•	Implements different enemy types.
•	Uses an interface (IEnemy) for flexibility.
🔹 ItemManager.java & Items (GoldCoin.java, HealthElixir.java, MagicScroll.java)
•	Manages item interactions.
•	Implements the IItem interface for modularity.
